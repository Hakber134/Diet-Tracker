# Diet-Tracker-App
Diet tracking app coded using Python. The current iteration works in the console, however, a future update will bring a full GUI/App release for the diet tracker, potentially using React Native. The final goal is to have a well-rounded fitness app deployed on the app store which allows for diet tracking, workout tracking, and user profile implementation.
