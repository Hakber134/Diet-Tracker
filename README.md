# Diet-Tracker
Diet tracker coded using Python. The current iteration works in the console, however, a future update will bring a full GUI/App release for the diet tracker. The final goal is to have a well-rounded fitness app deployed which allows for diet tracking, workout tracking, and user profile implementation.
